# Startups-Profit-Estimation
Estimate the profit of startups based on how much they will spend on each department from research and development, administration, and marketing departments and also based on which state they will start in. I have trained the model on linear regression, KNN regressor, and Random Forest regressor to compare between the accuracies of the 3 regressors.
